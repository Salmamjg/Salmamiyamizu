## Projects

- **Face Recognition Attendance Software**
  Developed a software using facial recognition technology to automate attendance tracking. The software, built with Python and utilizing OpenCV, can identify faces and mark attendance in real-time. I implemented two key algorithms: eigenfaces for feature extraction and Haar cascade for face detection. This project allowed me to dive into computer vision, machine learning, and Python programming.
